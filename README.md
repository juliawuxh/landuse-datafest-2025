### Land Use, Migration, and Environmental Inequality in Germany

🏆 **Best Visualization Award — DataFest Munich 2025**

This repository contains the data processing, analysis, and visualization work developed for **DataFest 2025 (Munich)**.  
Our project examines how disadvantaged populations — including low-income and migrant communities — are spatially distributed in relation to living space availability and environmental exposure across Germany.

## Research Question

How are disadvantaged populations — particularly low-income and migrant communities — spatially distributed with respect to:
- average living space,
- income,
- and environmental exposure  
across German municipalities and districts?
